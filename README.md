## About The Project

This script allows for the automation of the "Classic Dice" game on the BC.Game platform. It enables users to configure various parameters, such as betting strategies and risk management limits, and to observe the bot's performance in real-time.

### Features

-   **Flexible Strategies:** Easily implement and switch between different betting strategies (default is Fibonacci).
-   **Risk Management:** Built-in `stop-loss` and `stop-win` mechanisms to protect your bankroll.
-   **Trend Analysis:** A simple strategy to switch between betting Over/Under based on recent roll history.
-   **User Interface (UI):** A convenient on-screen overlay with Start/Pause, Stop, and Download buttons.
-   **History Logging:** Saves the complete game history to a `.csv` file for later analysis in spreadsheet software.
-   **Quiet Mode:** An option to hide detailed step-by-step logs from the console for a cleaner view.

## Configuration

All bot parameters can be easily configured at the beginning of the `bot.js` file:

```javascript
// === 1. BOT PARAMETERS ===
const initial_bet_unit = 0.01;      // The base unit for betting strategies
const chance = 70;                  // Target win chance in %
const stop_loss = -10;              // Stop if the balance drops by this amount
const stop_win = 20;                // Stop if the balance increases by this amount
const trend_window = 5;             // How many recent rolls to analyze for the trend
const delay_between_rolls = 3000;   // Delay between bets in milliseconds
const QUIET_MODE = true;            // Set to true to hide detailed console logs
